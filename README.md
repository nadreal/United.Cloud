**Automation Test cases for Eon Create/Delete Profile page**

Assuming that UI and Functional requirements are integrated in web API login/create/delete profile as it is.
  Initially we covered most of the scenarios and some edge cases in **_test_scenarios.txt_**.
  *Performance, robustness and ui tests are not required.*

  For writing automation test cases I used Selenium with the WebDriver library in **_CreateProfile.java_** and **_DeleteProfile.java_**.
  As we don't have access to the source code of Web API, this approach is not a best practice for writing functional cases (else it is good practice for a test-driven development).
  The Main goal was to cover just some main logic and principles of writing automation cases in this framework.
 
  _Since it's not my area of expertise (1st time using it) I believe it could be organised in a much better manner._

Additional exercises for sql, for the first two queries are in **_sql.txt_**.
